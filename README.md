# Gaming Console Inference
This project aims to infer whether there is a difference in the popularity of handheld and home video game consoles in North America, providing insights for video game companies on which platform to prioritize for game development. A simulation-based hypothesis test is first conducted to identify whether there is a difference in means between the two platforms within the sample. Further hypothesis testing is then conducted to validate the previous findings, through theory-based hypothesis testing using a two-sample t-test. The dataset used to conduct this project is the  [Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales) dataset found on Kaggle, by Gregory Smith. The project can be found at [project.ipynb](https://github.com/jsscachen/Gaming-Console-Inference/blob/main/vgconsole_project.ipynb).
